# Muscle Music

Muscle Music is an interactive system that uses electromyography (EMG) signals, electrical signals generated by muscle contractions, to control digital outputs like music and games. By placing EMG sensors on the body, users can trigger sound or actions using nothing but their muscles, creating a hands-free experience that blends biomedical engineering, real-time software, and creative expression.
